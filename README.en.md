# 🚨 Regime Propaganda Report Bot

**Report accounts connected to the Islamic regime propaganda machine on Instagram and X (Twitter).**

**Why?** Many anti-regime protesters have been wrongfully killed. Propaganda networks label them "terrorists" instead of the heroes they were. This tool helps report those accounts more easily.

## ⚠️ Caution

Using automation on Instagram or X **may result in a temporary restriction**. Use at your own risk.

I've personally used this multiple times without issues — the risk seems low.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

| "Instagram Tab: Not Found" | Make sure instagram.com is open in a tab and you're logged in |
