# 🚨 Regime Propaganda Report Bot (`regime-propaganda-report-bot`)

**Report accounts connected to the Islamic regime propaganda machine.**

**Why I made this:** Many anti-regime protesters have been wrongfully killed, and propaganda networks try to label them as “terrorists” instead of who they were. This tool helps people report those propaganda accounts more easily.

A browser window will open with the bot interface.

## ⚠️ Caution

Using bots on Instagram **may result in a temporary ban** on your account. Use at your own risk.

That said, I've used this tool multiple times without any issues - the probability seems pretty low.
