## ⚡ Quick Start

### Step 1: Download & Run

Download the project ZIP, **unzip** it, then run the launcher file — if Python or Chrome isn't installed, it will **automatically** open the download page for you.

| Mac | Windows |
|-----|---------|
| Double-click `Start Bot.command` | Double-click `Start Bot.bat` |

A browser window will open with the bot interface.

### Step 2: Setup Chrome

1. **Quit Chrome completely** first (Cmd+Q on Mac / close all windows on Windows)
2. Click **"Launch Chrome"** in the bot interface
3. **Log into Instagram** in the Chrome window that opens *(only needed once — session is saved)*

### Step 3: Start Reporting

Click **"Start"** in the bot interface — done!

## 📝 Adding Targets

The list is **already pre-filled** with accounts we've found. You can add your own by editing `data/targets.txt` — one username per line (without @):

```
username1
username2
username3
```

**Have a big list?** Make a pull request and we'll add them!

## ⚠️ Caution

Using bots on Instagram **may result in a temporary ban** on your account. Use at your own risk.

That said, I've used this tool multiple times without any issues — the probability seems pretty low.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Python not found" | Reinstall Python, check "Add to PATH" |
| Bot won't start | Make sure Chrome is installed |
| Permission denied (Mac) | Run: `chmod +x "Start Bot.command"` in Terminal |

**That's it!** 🎯
