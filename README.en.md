# 🚨 Regime Propaganda Report Bot

**Report accounts connected to the Islamic regime propaganda machine.**

**Why?** Many anti-regime protesters have been wrongfully killed. Propaganda networks label them "terrorists" instead of the heroes they were. This tool helps report those accounts more easily.

Using automation on Instagram **may result in a temporary restriction**. Use at your own risk.

I've personally used this multiple times without issues — the risk seems low.
