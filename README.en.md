# Regime Propaganda Report Bot

Report accounts connected to the Islamic regime's propaganda machine on Instagram and X.

Many anti-regime protesters have been wrongfully killed. Propaganda networks label them "terrorists" instead of the heroes they were. This tool helps report those accounts.

The bot reports each account for "False information" with 15-25 second intervals.

### X (Twitter)

## Adding Targets

Edit the text box in the popup. One username per line, without @:

```
username1
username2
username3
```

The pre-filled list is a starting point. Add or remove accounts as you see fit. If you notice someone incorrectly included, please let us know.

---

## Daily Limit

The bot pauses after 200 reports per day to help prevent account restrictions. This is conservative: I've done 500+ in a day without issues. Click "Continue Anyway" to override.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Tab not found | Open the platform in a tab and log in |
| Can't see icon | Click puzzle icon → pin extension |
| Stops mid-way | Platform UI may have changed: check for updates |
| Nothing happens | Refresh the platform tab |

---

## Caution

Using automation on Instagram or X may result in temporary restrictions. Use at your own risk.
